To install iBuntu 1.4 Catalinux:

* Run "Install iBuntu 1.4 Catalinux" from Desktop or Launchpad
* Follow the instructions
* After installation, click the "Hard Reboot" icon in the very
  right of the Dock or through the Launchpad
* A prompt asks you for a password. Just enter: ibuntu
####################################################################

* IMPORTANT: Do NOT try to restart the system otherwise. 
  It will lead you to "SQUASHFS" error messages and you will have to
  power off your machine by hand!!!!!
  This is a known bug for Ubuntu 18.04.6 with Kernl 5.4.0-121
  Therefore we provided you this "Hard Reboot" option, to shut down
  the Live-System after you are finished with installation.

* The Splash-Screen won't be visible until you once rebootet the
  freshly installed system from Live-System with "Hard Reboot" 
  (or manually switching off the machine by hand), than reboot
  into the newly installed iBuntu Catalinux and than perform a 
  "normal" Restart from there. 


Have fun.
